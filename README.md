# ArgentBank
A banking app with auth<br/>
Created with React App and Redux - Redux Toolkit

### Dependencies

- [React](https://fr.reactjs.org/) v18.2.0
- [React-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) v18.2.0
- [React-router-dom](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) v6.3.0

### 1 | Back-end

1. Download or clone the back-end's repository :

```sh
git clone (https://github.com/MarineHgns/Project-10-Bank-API.git)
```
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Start local dev server
npm run dev:server
# Populate database with two users
npm run populate-db
```

Your server should now be running at http://locahost:3001 and you will now have two users in your MongoDB database!

## Populated Database Data

Once you run the `populate-db` script, you should have two users in your database:

### Tony Stark

- First Name: `Tony`
- Last Name: `Stark`
- Email: `tony@stark.com`
- Password: `password123`

### Steve Rogers

- First Name: `Steve`,
- Last Name: `Rogers`,
- Email: `steve@rogers.com`,
- Password: `password456`

## API Documentation

To learn more about how the API works, once you have started your local environment, you can visit: http://localhost:3001/api-docs

## Design Assets

Static HTML and CSS has been created for most of the site and is located in: `/designs`.

For some of the dynamic features, like toggling user editing, there is a mock-up for it in `/designs/wireframes/edit-user-name.png`.

And for the API model that you will be proposing for transactitons, the wireframe can be found in `/designs/wireframes/transactions.png`.

### 2 | Front-end

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
# NPM
npm install
```

3. Launch dev server on port 3000 :

```sh
# NPM
npm run start
```

4. Front-end is now rendered at URL `http://localhost:3000` and you can navigate on the site.
